Trust rating for social media identities

General Direction:
* Auth: oAuth via social media providers, e.g. facebook, etc
* Users can rate any social media item: 1-5 stars for trust rating
* Users can post on the platform
* Users can have connections
* Reply, like, dislike, RATE (see above)
* frontend in react native
* Backend will be express
* mongodb as backend storage
* deploy will be to heroku
* storybook will be optional
* Review package.json, is there redundant dependencies?
